        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Easy, buttery, perfectly seasoned, and impossible to resist eating it straight out of the pot, homemade mashed potato was never so simple to make and totally mouthwatering!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1.5 kg potatoes, peeled and cut into 2.5cm cubes</strong><em> preferably Sebago, Russet or Maris Piper</em></li>
            <li><strong>1 tbsp salt</strong><em> for cooking</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Flavorings:</h4>  
        <ul>
            <li><strong>60g / 4 tbsp unsalted butter </strong><em> chopped</em></li>
            <li><strong>1/3 cup milk</strong><em> preferably warmed</em></li>
            <li><strong>1/2 tsp salt</strong></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Garnish:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Extra melted butter</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Chives or parsley</strong><em> chopped</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place in a large pot with 1 tbsp salt. Add water so it’s 10cm / 4” above potatoes.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce heat so it’s simmering rapidly. Cook 15 minutes or until potatoes are very soft (jab with fork to test, they should fall apart).</li>
            <li>Drain well, return into pot. Leave for 1 minute, shaking pot every now and then, to encourage evaporation of water.</li>
            <li>Add Flavorings then mash well, using milk to make it looser if desired.</li>
            <li><strong>DO NOT</strong> use: a beater, stick blender, food processor or blender. You can pulse with a stand mixer or handheld mixer but be cautious, stop as soon as it's creamy (potatoes will quickly go from perfect to gluey using appliances).</li>
            <li>Transfer to serving bowl, make pretty swirls across the top and drizzle over butter. Sprinkle with chives then serve!</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Make Ahead/ Keeping Warm - Choose:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>30 minutes or less</strong> - Cover bowl tightly with cling wrap and keep in a warm place (like near the stove), will stay warm for 30 min. Gently stir before serving.</li>
            <li><strong>Up to 2 hours</strong>, over hot water - place bowl with mash over a pot of boiling hot water (turn stove on every now and then to keep water hot) or keep about 3 cm / 1" water gently simmering. Bowl should not touch water.</li>
            <li><strong>Up to 4 hours</strong>, slow cooker warm seeting - press baking paper/parchment paper onto potato surface, then cover tightly with foil. Keep in slow cooker on WARM setting (60C/140F or less).</li>
